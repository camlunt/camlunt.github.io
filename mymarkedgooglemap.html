var hhsinfo = '<h1>Highland High School</h1><h3>I went to school here form 9-12th grade. I loved my teachers and made some great friends. I was on the tennis team for 3 years, and in the pit orchestra for the musical "Beauty and the Beast." My high school has an outstanding music program and nearly every time I go to a BYU music performance I know somebody on the program from HHS.</h3>';

Since we opened, we have won Gilbert's Best New Business, Best Bakery, and Best Dessert. My favorite two things to eat are lemon blueberry cinnamon rolls and oatmeal chocolate chip cookies (which is one of the few times I risk eating chocolate since I'm allergic).</h3>";
var harkinsinfo = '<h1>Harkins Movie Theater</h1><h3>I might be biased, but this is the best unassigned-seating movie theater I have ever been to! Fun fact: this Harkins location (Superstition Springs 25) is the largest Harkins Theater! I personally have a problem with the tiny theaters in Utah that only show 5 movies at a time #imspoiled. My favorite movie that I have seen in this theater is probably Mary Poppins Returns. The day before my brother got set apart as a missionary, and per his request, my family went and saw Incredibles 2 together.</h3>';
